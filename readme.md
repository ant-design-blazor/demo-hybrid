### AntDesign Maui Test App
This app is tested in Visual Studio(Version 17.3.5) with andriod emulator installed.

### Debug
However, porting into maui app still remains several bugs. These bugs may caused by difference of file reading between web and local app.

### Performance
Blazor hybrid maui app runs your web ui in webview, unlike webassembly or web hosted, it can run your c# code locally, which makes it easier and faster to access the local APIs and devices.
